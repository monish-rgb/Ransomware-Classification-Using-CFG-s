# Ransomware-Classification-Using-CFG-s

This project deals with Ransomware PE binary executable files Control Flow Graphs(CFG's) are extracted from these files using IDA Pro tool.
Network and graph level features are extracted from CFG's then clubbed them to form a dataset. Machine Learning methods like SVM, RandomForest are used
to classify the binary file.
